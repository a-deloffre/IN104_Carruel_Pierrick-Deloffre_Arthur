1. Check if the articles (*.xml.json) have already been modified (into *.txt) : if not, run main.py first (part 1)
2. Check your index folder : if you run main_part2 with new parameters, you need to delete every doc in the index folder
3. Check if the paths you wrote in your code are the right ones

You can run the main code now !
